          The reason I created this website because I too am a Pup Parent, I've
          had dogs in the past but never of my very own. Sometime around the
          beginning of August of 2023 I adopted my baby who is named Jack. He's
          the mascot for this website. Don't trust his cute face. Anyways I had
          to find a vet, I had to find the food he ate and see if that was good
          for him. I had to find training treats, toys, beds, etc. I also had to
          search up how to train him so he doesn't develop bad habits. Many of
          the sites I looked at ended up taking a while to find the one thing I
          needed. It was pain, I wished for a site only for puppies and had the
          things you need right up front. Thus! Pup Parents was born. I hope
          this website helps you find what you need. If you have any
          suggestions, please let us know! Our contact information can be found
          down below in a link. Have a nice day!
